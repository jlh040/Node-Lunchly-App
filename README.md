### Node Lunchly App

#### Functionality

- This is a Springboard exercise and Express app that mimics a reservation application for a restaurant. It allows a user to view a list of customers, add a customer, get detailed information about each customer, edit a customer, view a customer's reservations, and add a reservation for each customer.
- Most of the code was written by Rithm School; however, this was another chance for me to understand a new codebase, and then implement some features. Also, I got some practice working with a custom ORM and seeing how easily we can use object oriented programming to abstract database operations in Node.

#### Technicalities

- To get this code onto your machine, first run `git clone https://github.com/jlh040/Node-Lunchly-App.git`
- Then, assuming you have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed, run `createdb lunchly` in your terminal to create the database for the application.
- After that, run `psql < data.sql` to seed the database.
- Now, assuming you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, run `npm install` to download all of the dependencies.
- Finally run `node server.js` to start the server, and head on over to **localhost:3000** to start using the application.
